Sequement
=========

A light-weight sequence server daemon in Ruby.

A master process sets up a listening socket, and forks child processes to
accept connections.  Inbound connections send commands parsed by the child
process, which communicates back to the master using pipes for IPC.

Persistence will be asynchronous, with blocks of sequences reserved in
advance such that crashing will result in request gaps rather than re-use.
